Because I have no idea how to do a curved text widget, let alone one curved in 2 dimensions.\nA wooden signpost, and a wall sign.  And a rectangular vellum poster, in portrait or landscape arrangement.\nTo edit the text on the storage, long activate and select interact. <- just so it doesn't pop everytime you put things away.",
