Because I have no idea how to do a curved text widget, let alone one curved in 2 dimensions.\nA wooden signpost, and a wall sign.  And a rectangular vellum poster, in portrait or landscape arrangement.\nTo edit the text on the storage, long activate and select interact. <- just so it doesn't pop everytime you put things away.\n\nNote: This mod is a split/sub-section of my RP Assets mod, don't install both\n\nhttps://discord.gg/h45bTeqNRs",
	"changeNote": "Added 2 Vellum variations using a new Gothic font that is surprisingly readable.\nIncreased sign and poster max character count.  Obviously if you don't add line breaks this could become unreadable, but with sensible breaks this limits the use less than before.",
